Shortens URL using TinyURL API. The frontend (REACTJS) contacts the backend (NodeJS - ExpressJS) and the backend then requests TinyURL API to create a shorten link. I could've just sent the request from the front-end but I wanted to add a bit of complexity to the project and 
use expressjs to feel more comfortable with it.
